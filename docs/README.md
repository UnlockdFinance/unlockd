# Introduction

## Introduction to Unlockd

Unlockd is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. It is, at its core, a set of smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet, where depositors provide liquidity in the form of ERC20 tokens to earn a passive income. At the same time, borrowers can receive overcollateralized loans by setting their non-fungible ERC721 assets as collateral. The following document contains relevant information about the Smart Contracts designed for the Unlockd protocol, as well as an overview of the most relevant scenarios.

## Risk Framework

At Unlockd, we understand the potential risks of market volatility and how it can affect the protocol. Because of that, we are constantly seeking new ways to make the protocol safer and more reliable. Unlockdâ€™s Risk Framework breaks down some of the key risks of the protocol and the mitigation techniques in place. You can check the risk framework documentation [here](https://github.com/UnlockdFinance/unlockd-protocol-v1/blob/master/RiskFramework.pdf).

## Contract interactions and use cases

### Deposit

Users can deposit ERC-20 tokens to the protocol via the deposit() function in the LendPool.sol contract. It deposits an amount of underlying asset to the reserves of the protocol, receiving in return overlying uTokens representing the deposit position. In order to deposit, the user must provide the contract with information about the asset and amount to be deposited, as well as the address that will receive the corresponding uTokens. You can check the deposit diagrams [here](https://github.com/UnlockdFinance/unlockd-protocol-v1/blob/development\_\_documentation/assets/deposit.png).

### Withdraw

Users can withdraw their deposited assets by triggering the withdraw() function in the LendPool. The withdrawal process burns the equivalent uTokens owned, returning the original asset to the user. To perform a successful withdrawal, users must specify the asset and amount to withdraw, as well as the address that will receive the underlying assets.&#x20;

### Borrow

The Unlockd protocol allows users to borrow against their NFT assets, setting them as collateral. Each NFT provided as collateral will be linked to a single loan, containing all the data corresponding to the borrow position. The borrowing process requires the user to specify the asset and amount to be borrowed, the collection address and token ID for the non-fungible asset to be set as collateral, and finally, an address to specify the loan receiver.&#x20;

### Repay

Providing users with over-collateralized loans implies a return of the borrowed amount plus a small fee. The repay function in the LendPool allows users to perform this return of borrowed assets, getting their collateralized non-fungible asset back. To repay, the collection address and token ID for the NFT must be provided, as well as the desired amount to repay. The amount is specified because partial repayments are allowed (for example, to increase a user's health factor).&#x20;

### Redeem

Users can find themselves in a situation where their health factor has dropped below 1, thus triggering the auction process. In this case, the collateral owner can redeem the NFT loan, thus burning the loan and receiving the non-fungible asset back. In this case, the user must specify the collection address and token ID for the NFT, the amount to repay the debt, and an additional bid fine as a penalty for triggering the auction process.

### Liquidate

The liquidation process starts with a non-fungible asset used as collateral in the protocol reaching a health factor value below 1. An external server monitors all the protocol loans, identifying unhealthy loans. When an unhealthy loan is identified, the NFT can be set to auction. The auction process begins with Unlockd setting a minimum bid price from the liquid NFT marketplace, NFTX. Duration is set for the auction, and users can bid above the minimum price or the previous highest bid (the first bid will benefit from a return fee to incentivize bids). There are two scenarios when an auction gets triggered:

1. If there have been bids, the NFT will be sold to the highest bidder, thus liquidating the NFT and allowing the protocol to get the loaned amount back.
2. If there are no bids, the NFT is liquidated via NFTX. An external server will monitor the auction duration and trigger the NFTX liquidation if no bids are placed.&#x20;
