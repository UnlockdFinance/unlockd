<p align="center">
Unlockd is a decentralized non-custodial NFT lending protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized fashion, using NFTs as collaterl.

<p align="center">
This repository contains the smart contracts source code and markets configuration for Unlockd Protocol. The repository uses Hardhat as development enviroment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

> **üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Thanks**
> Unlockd protocol refers to the architecture design and adopts some of the code of [AAVE](https://github.com/aave).
> We are very grateful to AAVE for providing us with an excellent DeFi platform.

You can join at the [Discord](https://discord.gg/unlockd) channel or at the [Governance](https://snapshot.org/#/unlockddao.eth) for asking questions about the protocol or talk about Unlockd with other peers.

# üìù Documentation

The documentation of Unlockd Protocol is in the following [Unlockd documentation](https://github.com/UnlockdFinance/unlockd-protocol-v1/blob/development__documentation/Documentation.md) link. At the documentation you can learn more about the protocol, see the contract interfaces, integration guides and audits.

For getting the latest contracts addresses, please check the [Deployed contracts](https://docs.unlockddao.xyz/developers/deployed-contracts) page at the documentation to stay up to date.


# üé¨ Setup

- Install

To run Unlockd, install its dependencies using yarn. You will need [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed in your system.
```bash
yarn install
```

- Create an enviroment file named `.env` and fill the next enviroment variables

```bash
# Private key. Add it if you just want to interact with Hardhat with a single address.
PRIVATE_KEY=""

# Mnemonic. Used by Hardhat if PRIVATE_KEY is not set. Also used in  `./unlockd-tasks`.
MNEMONIC=""

# Used in `./unlockd-tasks` to simulate a user different than the owner.
PRIVATE_KEY_USER=""

# Alchemy/Infura RPC endpoint URL.
RPC_ENDPOINT=""

# Optional Etherscan key, for automatize the verification of the contracts at Etherscan
ETHERSCAN_KEY=""
ETHERSCAN_NETWORK="" # network in use

# Optional, add it if you want to run tasks in a forked network environment
FORK=""

# Optional, add it if you want to specify block number running tasks in a forked network
FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER=""

```

# üß™ Test

You can run the full test suite with the following commands. All of them are explained in detail in the [tasks section](#tasks):

```bash
yarn test

yarn test:localhost

yarn test:file
```

## Markets configuration

The configurations related with the Unlockd Markets are located at `markets` directory. You can follow the `IUnlockdConfiguration` interface to create new Markets configuration or extend the current Unlockd configuration.

Each market should have his own Market configuration file, and their own set of deployment tasks, using the Unlockd market config and tasks as a reference.

# ‚úÖ Tasks

## General tasks
You can run the general tasks defined in the `package.json` file by using yarn and specifying the task you want to run. For example, we can run the `compile` task with the following command:
``` bash
yarn compile
```

## Unlockd tasks
Unlockd tasks are a specific set of tasks that allow direct interaction with the currently deployed contracts. They require a set of params to be passed as flags in the command, which will be translated to be the params passed to the function to be executed. All params are explained in the definition of each task. These set of tasks can be run in terminal by using Hardhat commands. Network specification is fetched from the RPC_ENDPOINT environment variable. As an example, we'll try to run a 1 WETH deposit into the LendPool. The `deposit` task takes three params (`amount`, `reservename`, and `to`), and the task name is `lendpool:deposit`, so the command to run will be:

```bash
npx hardhat lendpool:deposit --amount 100000000000000000 --reservename WETH --to 0x1a470e9916f3dFF8E268A69A39fa2E9F7B954927
```
<details>
    <summary>Show Unlockd tasks</summary>

| Task | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| lendpool:deposit | Deposits an amount in the LendPool  |
| lendpool:withdraw  | Withdraws an amount from the LendPool  |
| configurator:configureNftAsCollateral  | Sets the configuration parameters to the specified NFT  |
| lendpool:borrow  | Borrows an amount of a specific reserve from unlockd, depositing an NFT as collateral  |
| lendpool:getdebtdata  | Returns de debt data for a given loan  |
| lendpool:getauctiondata  | Returns de auction data for a given loan that is in auction state  |
| lendpool:repay  | Repays a specified amount from a previous borrow to the LendPool  |
| lendpool:redeem | Redeems a specific amount from an auctioned NFT and pays a bid fine  |
| lendpool:auction | Places a bid for an unhealthy position in the protocol  |
| lendpool:liquidate | Liquidates an unhealthy position, transferring the NFT to the liquidator |
| lendpool:liquidateNFTX | Liquidates an unhealthy position in NFTX market |

</details>

# üöÄ Deployments

For deploying Unlockd Protocol, you can use the available scripts located at `package.json`. For a complete list, run `npm run` to see all the tasks.

### Prepare

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

```

### Localhost dev deployment

```bash
# In first terminal
npm run hardhat:node

# In second terminal
npm run unlockd:localhost:dev:migration
```

### Localhost full deployment

```bash
# In first terminal
npm run hardhat:node

# In second terminal
npx hardhat --network localhost "dev:deploy-mock-reserves"
# then update pool config reserve address

npx hardhat --network localhost "dev:deploy-mock-nfts"
# then update pool config nft address

npx hardhat --network localhost "dev:deploy-mock-aggregators" --pool Unlockd
# then update pool config reserve aggregators address

npx hardhat --network localhost "dev:deploy-mock-unft-registry" --pool Unlockd
# then update pool config unft registry address

npx hardhat --network localhost "dev:deploy-mock-unft-tokens" --pool Unlockd
```

### Goerli mock deployment (a full deployment may not run because of ERC20 and ERC721 Reserves)

```bash
# In one terminal
npm run unlockd:goerli:mock:migration
```

## Interact with Unlockd in Mainnet via console

You can interact with Unlockd at Mainnet network using the Hardhat console, in the scenario where the frontend is down or you want to interact directly. You can check the deployed addresses at [deployed-contracts](https://docs.unlockddao.xyz/developers/deployed-contracts).

Run the Hardhat console pointing to the Mainnet network:

```bash
npx hardhat --network main console
```

At the Hardhat console, you can interact with the protocol:

```javascript
// Load the HRE into helpers to access signers
run("set-DRE");

// Import getters to instance any Unlockd contract
const contractGetters = require("./helpers/contracts-getters");

// Load the first signer
const signer = await contractGetters.getFirstSigner();

// Lend pool instance
const lendPool = await contractGetters.getLendPool("");

// ERC20 token WETH Mainnet instance
const WETH = await contractGetters.getIErc20Detailed("");

// Approve 10 WETH to LendPool address
await WETH.connect(signer).approve(lendPool.address, ethers.utils.parseUnits("10"));

// Deposit 10 WETH
await lendPool.connect(signer).deposit(DAI.address, ethers.utils.parseUnits("10"), await signer.getAddress(), "0");
```
